# learning-data-manipulation-with-pandas

This is a guided project from DataCamp which I used to learn how to manipulate data with pandas as the title of the README.md file suggests.  

Below are the instructions I followed to learn the process:  
## Explore Datasets    
Use the DataFrames imported in the first cell to explore the data and practice your skills!  

- Print the highest weekly sales for each department in the walmart DataFrame. Limit your results to the top five departments, in descending order. If you're stuck, try reviewing this [video](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/data-manipulation-with-pandas/aggregating-dataframes?ex=1).  
- What was the total nb_sold of organic avocados in 2017 in the avocado DataFrame? If you're stuck, try reviewing this [video](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/data-manipulation-with-pandas/slicing-and-indexing-dataframes?ex=6).  
- Create a bar plot of the total number of homeless people by region in the homelessness DataFrame. Order the bars in descending order. Bonus: create a horizontal bar chart. If you're stuck, try reviewing this [video](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/data-manipulation-with-pandas/creating-and-visualizing-dataframes?ex=1).  
- Create a line plot with two lines representing the temperatures in Toronto and Rome. Make sure to properly label your plot. Bonus: add a legend for the two lines. If you're stuck, try reviewing this [video](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/data-manipulation-with-pandas/creating-and-visualizing-dataframes?ex=1).
